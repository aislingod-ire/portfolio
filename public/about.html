<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Aisling, I'm a 27 year old gal from Ireland, and trying to take on the world of Web Development, starting from scratch!</p>

<p>I've always been incredibly curious about the structure and underlying logic to websites, and how some can look beautiful, while others just don't. </p>

<p>I'm undertaking this course solo, and planning on learning the fundamentals after my full-time job as a Project Manager ends in the evenings.
  I hope you enjoy this lovely Irish quote that I've included, set against Irish scenery.
